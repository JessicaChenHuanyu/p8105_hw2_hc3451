# Problem 1

``` r
pols_month <- read.csv("./pols-month.csv")
snp <- read.csv("./snp.csv")
unemployment <- read.csv("./unemployment.csv")

# First Step of Data Cleaning: pols_month
pols_month <- pols_month |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") |>
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) |>
  mutate(president = ifelse("prez_dem" == 1, "dem", "gop")) |>
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

``` r
# Second Step of Data Cleaning: snp
snp <- snp |>
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") |>
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) |>
  mutate(year = ifelse(as.numeric(year) <= 20, paste0("20", year), paste0("19", year))) |>
  select(year, month, everything())
```

``` r
# Third Step of Data Cleaning: unemployment
unemployment = pivot_longer(unemployment, Jan:Dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "unemployment")
unemployment <- unemployment |>
  mutate(month = month.name[factor(month)]) |>
  mutate(year = tolower(Year)) |>
  select(-Year) |>
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

``` r
# Join the datasets
merged_data_1 <- merge(pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month"), all.x = TRUE)
merged_data <- merge(merged_data_1, unemployment, by = c("year", "month"), all.x = TRUE)
```

# Conclusion

The final merged dataset involves three datasets: “pols” containing
political data, “snp” with stock market information, and “unemployment”
providing economic indicators. It comprises 822 observations and 12
variables, spanning from year 1947 to 2015. Key variables include
`year`, `month`, and `unemployment_rate`, alongside some political and
stock market indicators.

``` r

```

# Conclusion

This combined dataset has 845 observations. The variable `source`
represents the origin of the data and `homes_powered` represents the
number of homes powered based on electricity from trash. The total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26 and the
total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is
1.63^{4}.

# Problem 3

``` r
base <- read.csv("./MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1)
base <- janitor::clean_names(base)
base <- base |>
  mutate(sex = if_else(sex == 0, 'female', 'male')) |>
  mutate(apoe4 = if_else(apoe4 == 0, 'non-carrier', 'carrier'))

base_filtered <- base |>
  filter(age_at_onset != ".")
```

Important steps in the import process and relevant features of the
dataset include deleting the first row, cleaning variable names to a
tidy format, and mutating the ‘sex’ and ‘apoe4’ variables from numeric
values to their respective real categories. 483 participants were
recruited, and of these 97 develop MCI.

``` r
base_mean = mean(pull(base_filtered, current_age))

data_female <- base_filtered |>
  filter(sex == "female")
proportion <- sum(data_female$apoe4 == "carrier") / nrow(data_female)
```

The average baseline age is 65.6113402. Moreover, 65.22% of women in the
study are APOE4 carriers.

``` r
amyloid <- read.csv('./mci_amyloid.csv', skip = 1)
amyloid <- janitor::clean_names(amyloid)
amyloid <- amyloid |>
  rename(id = study_id,
         ratio_2_year = time_2,
         ratio_4_year = time_4,
         ratio_6_year = time_6,
         ratio_8_year = time_8)
```

Important steps in the import process and relevant features of the
dataset include deleting the first row, cleaning variable names to a
tidy format, and renaming variables to their respective real categories.

``` r
base_participants <- base_filtered$participant_id
amyloid_participants <- amyloid$participant_id

only_in_base <- setdiff(base_filtered$id, amyloid$id)
only_in_amyloid <- setdiff(amyloid$id, base_filtered$id)

combined_dataset <- inner_join(base_filtered, amyloid, by = "id")
write.csv(combined_dataset, "combined_dataset.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

# Conclusion

Some participants (with id: 14, 49, 268) appear in only the baseline;
while some participants appear in only the amyloid datasets.
`combined_dataset` (has 94 observations) combined participants who
appear in both datasets.
